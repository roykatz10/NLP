      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "the aim of this study was to investigate the serum level of fat-soluble vitamins a, d and e in clinically healthy lactating female camel (camelus dromedarius) and suckling calf \u003E one-year-old during winter and summer seasons in five main regions of saudi arabia. 60 sera samples were collected and tested for vitamins a, d and e levels and the results were statistically analyzed. the statistical mean value of vitamin a was within the reported range but for d and e, there were minor variations. the effect of season was insignificant (p \u003E 0.05) for vitamins a and e in the combined results of the dam and newborn together. this seasonal effect was highly significant in dam serum (p \u003C 0.05). region effect was significant for vitamin a in the northern area (p \u003C 0.05) and for vitamin e in the southern region (p \u003C 0.05). correlations analysis revealed significant results in the season vs vitamin a and e p \u003C 0.05. mean values of vitamins a, d and e in dam and newborn did not observe significant variations however, in the season and regions there were significant variations which can be attributed to the climate difference, availability of balanced rations and camel management in each location of the five main regions of saudi arabia. there is a great need for further studies and the consequent development of supplementation programs and camel feed manufacturers awareness of such results is highly recommended.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect."

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect."

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect."

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect."

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "ocupaciones. los mayores causantes de la brecha salarial de gnero son las diferencias en las ocupaciones e industrias en las que es ms probable que trabajen mujeres y hombres. las mujeres representan 2 de cada 3 trabajadores a tiempo completo en ocupaciones que pagan menos de $30,000 al ao, y menos de 1 de cada 3 a tiempo completo en trabajos que pagan como promedio $100,000 o ms. sin embargo, incluso en las mismas ocupaciones, las mujeres en promedio ganan menos que los hombres. march 14 is equal pay day. here are five fast facts about the gender wage gap. edad. la brecha salarial de gnero no se resuelve por s sola a medida que avanza la edad de las mujeres y crecen en sus carreras. de hecho, la brecha salarial para trabajadoras mayores es superior que para mujeres ms jvenes. y las mujeres mayores negras e hispanas registran las diferencias salariales ms extremas.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect."

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "the aim of this study was to investigate the serum level of fat-soluble vitamins a, d and e in clinically healthy lactating female camel (camelus dromedarius) and suckling calf \u003E one-year-old during winter and summer seasons in five main regions of saudi arabia. 60 sera samples were collected and tested for vitamins a, d and e levels and the results were statistically analyzed. the statistical mean value of vitamin a was within the reported range but for d and e, there were minor variations. the effect of season was insignificant (p \u003E 0.05) for vitamins a and e in the combined results of the dam and newborn together. this seasonal effect was highly significant in dam serum (p \u003C 0.05). region effect was significant for vitamin a in the northern area (p \u003C 0.05) and for vitamin e in the southern region (p \u003C 0.05). correlations analysis revealed significant results in the season vs vitamin a and e p \u003C 0.05. mean values of vitamins a, d and e in dam and newborn did not observe significant variations however, in the season and regions there were significant variations which can be attributed to the climate difference, availability of balanced rations and camel management in each location of the five main regions of saudi arabia. there is a great need for further studies and the consequent development of supplementation programs and camel feed manufacturers awareness of such results is highly recommended.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect."

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect."

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",

      "until now, we have only considered the distribution of resource-limited face masks (i.e. surgical masks). however, a number of countries, as well as the who, have introduced recommendations for the use of homemade masks, or face coverings, in public, in areas where community transmission is occurring. while the effectiveness of face coverings is likely to be limited, universal adoption would result in a reduction of r 0 by a factor of r t r s , where r t and r s are the relative transmission and relative susceptibility associated with face masks, respectively. a universally adopted homemade mask offering just 5% protection and containment would thus reduce r 0 from 2.5 to 2.26. adoption of universal face coverings provided a considerable reduction in total deaths (fig. 5). this reduction was comparable to that achieved with a targeted distribution of surgical masks, even with supplies limited to 10% of the population. for a population with a universal recommendation for face covering in public (e.g. the united states post april 2020), a reduction of 35% in deaths may be expected; an additional targeted distribution of surgical masks to the elderly and symptomatic (e.g. who guidelines post june 2020) can at least double this effect.",
